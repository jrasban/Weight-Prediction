# Weight-Prediction
This is a prediction model intended to predict the weight of an individual based on data from the CDC. Variables contained in this model include: height, upper arm size, upper leg size, waist size, and BMI (to name just a few). 

## Data Cleansing and Preprocessing
Data was pull from the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Exam Survey for 2017-2018 in XPT format. The data came in two separate files that were subsequently loaded into a Python and filtered. Cleansed and chosen data was then converted into a CSV format and placed into a SQL Server Database for further cleansing and preprocessing.

Since preprocessing was done in SQL Server, a CSV version is provided in this repository so that the model can be run successfully.
